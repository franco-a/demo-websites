## Procedure
My approach for this site was a mobile-first philosophy that adds complexity as the
screen size gets larger. The site is fully responsive from mobile to tablet and to desktop.
I aimed to make my code and file architecture modular and reusable. Despite just being a demo, I put an effort to make all my code readable and maintanable. The site was made with accessibility in mind, giving awareness to users who would tab through sites and to screen reader users.
